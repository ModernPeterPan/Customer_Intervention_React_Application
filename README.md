On the website you can switch from the Home, Login and/or Form tab.

The Login API is not functionning properly for the moment and then you can just ignore that tab. 
The Home page has a GET API showing only the "pending" status of the customer 1 interventions. Not the active or inactive.
The Form page can update any of Customer 1 interventions to active, pending or inactive. 

If you change to status to anything that is not "pending" it will disappear from the Home page. Only if you put it back to "pending" wil it appears on
the Home page.
